title: Beat the Goalie — Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to create a football game in which the player has to score as many goals as they can in 30 seconds.

#Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

The 'Project Materials' link for this project contains the following resources:

#Learning Objectives
+ Events;
+ Sequecing;
+ Repetition;
+ Decisions;
+ Broadcasting;
+ Variables.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

#Challenges
+ "Goal!" - Creating a broadcast message for when a goal is scored;
+ "Adding a score" - Creating and using a `score` {.blockdata} variable;
+ "More controls" - Adding code to control the goalie;
+ "Manual control" - Adding keyboard controls for the football.

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ If the football's direction has been changed, it may bounce around the screen instead of just moving left and right. This can be fixed by setting the direction in the sprite properties, or by adding a `point in direction` {.blockmotion} block to the start of the football's code.
