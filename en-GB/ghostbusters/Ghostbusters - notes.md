#Learning Objectives
+ Variables;
+ Random numbers.

#Challenges
+ "More randomness" - using random numbers;
+ "Adding a sound" - consolidating the learning of sounds;
+ "More objects" - applying skills to create another game object.

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ If children find it difficult to click the ghosts without dragging them around, they can play the game in fullscreen mode, in which ghosts aren't draggable.
