title: Catch the Dots — Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
In this project children will learn how to make a game, in which the player has to match up coloured dots with the corresponding part of the controller.

#Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

The 'Project Materials' link for this project contains the following resources:

####Project Resources

For this project, club members can make use of external resources that aren't available in the Scratch library:

+ controller.svg.

Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources.

For club members that aren't able to access these project resources, there is a Scratch project with the external resources pre-loaded. This is available online at [jumpto.cc/dots-resources](http://jumpto.cc/dots-resources), or in the downloadable project materials, which contains:

#Learning Objectives
+ This project consolidates learning of previous programming skills learnt.

#Challenges
+ "Spinning left" - creating code to move the controller;
+ "More dots" - creating more coloured dots that need to match the correct part of the controller';
+ "Faster moving dots" - using a variable to increase the speed of the dots throughout the game;
+ "Improve your game!" - adding new dots that manipulate the `score` {.blockdata}, `delay` {.blockdata} and `speed` {.blockdata} variables;
+ "Game menu" - creating a menu, with various stage backgrounds and buttons for moving between them.
