#Learning Objectives
+ This project includes the use of:
	+ loops;
	+ decisions;
	+ variables;
	+ relational (`>`) operator;
	+ coordinates.

#Challenges
+ "More movement" - consolidating learning of input events and coordinates;
+ "Changing your planet’s orbit" - using `motion` {.blockmotion} blocks to change sprite behaviour;
+ "More space junk" - sprite motion consolidation task;
+ "2 players" - using more input events to improve gameplay.
