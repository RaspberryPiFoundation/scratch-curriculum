#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make a platform game, making use of Scratch concepts and skills that have been learnt in previous projects.

#Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

You can find a completed version of this project <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/39740618/#editor">online</a>, or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ Dodgeball.sb2

There is also a version of this project with the external resources pre-loaded. This is available online at [jumpto.cc/dodge-resources](http://jumpto.cc/dodge-resources), or in the downloadable project materials, which contains:

+ DodgeballResources.sb2 

This link also includes a 'Project Resources' folder, which contains images that children will need to complete this project. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources.

#Learning Objectives
+ This project consolidates learning of previous programming skills learnt.

#Challenges
+ "Improved jumping" - using an additional `if` {.blockcontrol} block to fix a multiple-jump bug;
+ "Random balls" - using the `random` {.blockoperators} block to vary the ball costume, size and delay between clones;
+ "More obstacles" - adding additional sprites to the game;
+ "Improved gravity" - using an additional `if` {.blockcontrol} block to fix a bug in the `gravity` {.blockdata};
+ "More lives" - addition of a `lives` {.blockdata} variable.
