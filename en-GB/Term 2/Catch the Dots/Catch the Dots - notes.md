#Introduction:
In this project children will learn how to make a game, in which the player has to match up coloured dots with the corresponding part of the controller.

#Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

You can find a completed version of this project <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/44942820/#editor">online</a>, or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ CatchTheDots.sb2

There is also a version of this project with the external resources pre-loaded. This is available online at [jumpto.cc/dots-resources](http://jumpto.cc/dots-resources), or in the downloadable project materials, which contains:

+ CatchTheDotsResources.sb2 

This link also includes a 'Project Resources' folder, which contains images that children will need to complete this project. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources.

#Learning Objectives
+ This project consolidates learning of previous programming skills learnt.

#Challenges
+ "Spinning left" - creating code to move the controller;
+ "More dots" - creating more coloured dots that need to match the correct part of the controller';
+ "Faster moving dots" - using a variable to increase the speed of the dots throughout the game;
+ "Improve your game!" - adding new dots that manipulate the `score` {.blockdata}, `delay` {.blockdata} and `speed` {.blockdata} variables;
+ "Game menu" - creating a menu, with various stage backgrounds and buttons for moving between them.
