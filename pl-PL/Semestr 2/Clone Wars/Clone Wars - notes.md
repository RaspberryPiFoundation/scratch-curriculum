#Introduction:
In this project children will learn how to make a game, in which the player controls a spaceship that can fire lightning bolts at enemies.

For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

You can find a completed version of this project <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/46018140/#editor">online</a>, or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ CloneWars.sb2

#Learning Objectives
+ This project consolidates learning of previous programming skills learnt, and demonstrates how sprites can create clones of _other_ sprites, and how multiple clones can be used as projectiles.

#Challenges
+ "Fixing the lightning" - using a `wait` {.blockcontrol} block to reduce the frequency of the lightning;
+ "Lives and score" - creating `lives` {.blockdata}, `score` {.blockdata} and `highscore` {.blockdata} variables;
+ "Improve your game" - adding extra enemies, health packs, etc.
